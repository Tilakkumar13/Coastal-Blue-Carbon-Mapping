Coastal Blue Carbon Mapping ðŸŒŠðŸŒ¿
This project leverages Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyze and map coastal vegetation in the Sundarbans region, assessing vegetation cover and estimating carbon stock. The workflow combines Sentinel-2 and MODIS datasets to calculate NDVI, classify vegetation, and compare current data with historical trends.

Features
Vegetation Analysis: Uses Sentinel-2 imagery to calculate NDVI and classify vegetation.
Carbon Stock Estimation: Estimates carbon stock based on classified vegetation areas.
Historical Comparison: Utilizes MODIS NDVI data for vegetation change detection over time.
Interactive Mapping: Visualizes results directly on GEE.
Requirements
Google Earth Engine account.
Basic knowledge of JavaScript for working in the GEE code editor.
Files
main.js: Contains the GEE JavaScript code for the analysis.
README.md: Documentation for the project.
How to Use
Open the Google Earth Engine code editor.
Copy the code from main.js into the editor.
Run the script to visualize and analyze data for the Sundarbans region.
Results
NDVI visualizations showing vegetation health.
Classified maps highlighting vegetation and carbon stock.
Insights into vegetation loss and gain over time.
